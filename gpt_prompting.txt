I want you to complete the code I have considering the restrictions below:
- consider that the csv file used in the code is like the table below:

|   name   | parenting_age | lifetime |
|:--------:|:-------------:|:--------:|
|   Adam   |      130      |   930    |
|   Seth   |      105      |   912    |
|  Enosh   |       90      |   905    |


- I want you to create a Gantt charts with Python with matplotlib.
- I want the name of each one right behind each horizontal bar.
- Each bar will represent the lifetime of each one.
- I want each bar divided in 2 parts: the first part will represent the years until the parent age, and the rest of it will represent the amount of years until reach the lifetime.
- I want you creating each bar in the order that appears in the table. I mean Adam in the top and Enosh in the bottom.

Imcomplete code:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

df = pd.read_csv('genesis_characters.csv')
